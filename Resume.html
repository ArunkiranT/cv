      <li>In Spring 2021, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net/">Karen Levy</a> and I taught a new course, Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and will cover a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites.</li>
          <li>To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>
